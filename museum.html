            <p class="descrip">At the Municipal hall of Cordova, Cebu was an old house owned by the political clan "Sitoy" which is now a Museum of Cordova. The museum has an old religious relics which was used before in the church and some items found in the museum were donated by local cordovahanons to be displayed in the museum, I became interested to go to the museum because I like weapons and displayed in the museum were old knives. The museum is free though, no entrance at all, just wish it was maintained well by the local government because museums are meant to look on how rich the culture is.</p>
